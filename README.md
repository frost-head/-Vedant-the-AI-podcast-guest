# Vedant - AI LLM based Podcast Guest
 Introducing Vedant - a groundbreaking AI-powered podcast guest that revolutionizes the way we consume and engage with audio content. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies to deliver an interactive and dynamic experience, where listeners can pose questions and receive insightful, human-like responses from an advanced language model.
Features

# AI-Driven Conversations:
Powered by Google's Gemini large language model (LLM), Vedant generates contextually relevant and informative responses to listener questions.
Speech Recognition: OpenAI's Whisper speech-to-text model accurately transcribes audio input, enabling seamless voice interactions.
Contextual Awareness: The FAISS vector database retrieves relevant information from historical interactions and external knowledge sources, enhancing the contextual understanding of Vedant's responses.

# Natural Language Processing
spaCy, a robust NLP library, aids in understanding and processing listener queries.
Expressive Speech Synthesis: SunoAI's BARK text-to-speech model converts Vedant's responses into natural-sounding human speech, creating an immersive audio experience.
User-Friendly Interface: A Flask-based web application provides a platform for listeners to interact with Vedant through voice or text.
